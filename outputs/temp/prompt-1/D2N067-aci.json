    "The response provides a clear and concise summary of the medical conversation, covering all the necessary sections. However, it lacks some details from the original conversation, such as Elizabeth's history of being an active skier and gymnast, and the patient's denial of left knee pain. The response also uses some non-standard clinical terms, like \"medial aspect\" instead of \"inner side\". The verbosity is minimal, and the summary is mostly succinct. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4</s>"
