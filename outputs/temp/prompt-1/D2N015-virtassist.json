    "The response does a good job of summarizing the conversation, but it lacks the level of detail and accuracy found in a score 5 response. The summary is concise and relevant, but it does not fully capture the complexity of the patient's condition. For example, the response does not mention the patient's history of depression or the fact that she has been smoking less frequently. Additionally, the response does not provide a detailed explanation of the patient's current symptoms, such as the frequency of her shortness of breath or the severity of her palpitations. While the response does use standard clinical terminology, it could benefit from more specific details about the patient's condition. Overall, the response is a good attempt but falls short of the level of detail and accuracy found in a score 5 response. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3</s>",
